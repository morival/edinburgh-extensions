**Yo, Ho haul together, hoist the colours high Heave ho, thieves and beggars, never shall we die Yo, Ho haul together, hoist the colours high Heave ho, thieves and beggars, never shall we die** The King and his men stole the queen from her bed and bound her in her bones The seas be ours and by the powers Where we will...we'll roam.
