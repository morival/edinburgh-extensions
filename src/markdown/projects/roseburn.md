This project involved us taking down a 120 year old stone wall in order to build an extension at the back. To preserve the original character of the building the stone was handled with care so that we could reuse it for extensions. On top of this, we renovated the whole cottage, in the attic space we turned one big area into a couple rooms and a bathroom.
